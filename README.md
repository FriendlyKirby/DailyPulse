# My Personal Project

## A subtitle

A *bulleted* list:
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

An example of text with **bold** and *italic* fonts.  

include 2 or 3 of these elements


- daily streak app like duolingo has
    - different streaks for different activities?
- timer function that records how long you've been doing a certain task
    - being able to set custom tags
    - displaying it as an over time bar graph like toggl

It could be that you can create an activity and set certain tags for it
like an organization app, then your able to track your daily time commitment
to said activity and view your consistency (streak) and how much time you've
put into the activity on a daily basis (graph) [not sure if it should show 
just what day the activity was done or the time as well]

- should be very streamline
- stretch goals: create mobile version and add widgets

# DailyPulse: Log Time and Maintain Streaks to Achieve Your Goals

## What will the application do?
    The core idea of this app revolves around building consistency in your routines
by keeping track of how many continuous days you've worked on your goals and
logging your minutes/ hours to visualize the time you've committed.
Key Features:
- Create different tasks
- Group, organize, and sort tasks by tags
- Timer to record how long you've spent on a task
- Daily streak tracker for each task
- An overall time spent tracker for each task
- Visual bar graph to see daily time commitment for each task

## Who will use it?
    DailyPulse is designed for indivuals that are aiming to improve their productivity
and time management. This app is meant for users who need just that extra bit of
motivation, in the form of keeping up a daily streak. It's meant for those that
want to track their time spent and visualize it in a clean manner.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
    I've been looking into self improvement and productivity for a long time in my
journey to become the best version of myself. One of the biggest walls that I ran
into was a lack of motivation to keep up consistency in whatever tasks were
required. One day I noticed that there was an exception to this issue, my Duolingo
progress. The idea of wanting to maintain my daily streak kept pushing me to
practice and learn a new language. Along side this realization, I've also been
using an app called Toggl to keep a visual track of my time spent learning art.
However, my main issue with the app is that it's not actually meant for this purpose
and so it has a lot of unnecessary features. With the concepts of streaks combined
with the visual time loggins features, and a few more quality of life additions,
DailyPulse is the perfect productivity companion app that I've been
looking for.

    One of the core concepts that inspired this app is from a book called Atomic 
Habits. I gave this book a read from the reccomendation of a friend, and it helped
in changing my perspective on life goals and how to achieve them. It entails how
tiny behaviours can compound into remarkable results, which is what this app is
all about.
